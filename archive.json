My conclusion was that you need your whole system to be secure at some point in time because you won't be able to handle all the temporary copies within a modern computer. For examples caches are hell. There quite a few of them. Data stored there is only really written to where it should go if being flushed. You do not necessarily want to flush. You're slowing down the whole system and sometimes things may go wrong. Or your OS just decides that what you want is not what the OS wants. You can't just read a recently written key supposedly written to disk to make sure it's stored, because there may be just some cache (maybe even on the hard disk before the actual write operation on the disk). Sometimes you have to trust that everything's alright or it will get messy.\n\n\nI think the point of this is basically: should we elaborate on the design requirements/environment requirements for secure operations at the OS level?",

But  e. g. for the interval approach you could just sacrifice / omit a few (contradicts the last part of chapter four in the Internet-Draft, I think). Imagine the interval in the last point: Your advanced key was written successfully, you start using the OTS keys from the interval that are only stored in volatile memory and suddenly there's a blackout. You restart the system. Worst-case, all keys of your reserved intervall are gone.

Those two halves could be handled independently.  That is, the first part is stateless, that is, it can be handled just like any other private key, and we can focus in on the dynamically updated second part (the state).\n\nI might want to add to this that there is a funny thing going on where the private key mainly has confidentiality requirements whereas the state has, somewhat uniquely, stricter integrity requirements on whatever storage mechanism, which is also somewhat different from the usual things we expect when handling keys.",

Normally in cryptography, we suggest using different keys to reduce the amount of damage that is done if a key is leaked.  However, that doesn\u2019t apply here \u2013 here, if any private seed leaks, the adversary can sign anything they want (and while they may be limited to that specific sector, the adversary can still sign at will, given that there is no standard mechanisms to revoke signatures from a sector).  I would suggest using the same private seed for all sectors (unless it is significantly more convenient to not to) \u2013 it may make things simpler, and is no less secure.\n\nI may be missing some point why this makes sense to do so I'm creating this issue \u2014\u00a0I agree that we should clarify or indeed simplify the sectorization (and probably note why there's no point to different keys though it is possible).",

I know of four such techniques, each of which is \u201cbest\u201d by some criteria, and some of which update which nodes are stored during each signature, and one which does not (which ends up using more storage and require more hashes to sign, but also avoid issues with updating the nodes along with the state).  To what extent should this draft address this?  I should be the one to contribute text, should you decide it should be appropriate (although I would like some guidelines as to how thorough I should be \u2013 I could go one for quite some time\u2026)\n\nThe question is do we think this fits in scope?

If we continue in that vein, I believe that you should mention that in XMSS/XMSS^MT, RFC 8391 and NIST SP 800-208 differs on SHAKE-based parameter sets.  I would recommend using the NIST parameter sets, should you decide you need an XMSS+SHAKE parameter set (the SHAKE-128 parameter set that RFC 8391 uses with n=32 reduces security to 128 bits, which is significantly weaker than the design goal).\n>\n>Another thought (if we were continuing with the giving general advice about stateful hash based signatures) is on selecting the parameter set.  For example, LMS with \u201cw=8\u201d (which would be w=256 in XMSS terminology) approximately halves the signature size, at the cost of making the signature generation and verification processes more expensive.  How far should we go into that (given that it is covered by other documents)\n\nI feel that \"picking parameters\" is a bit more of an operator concern and we do already touch on that (for example in that you need to consider your state management solutions when picking parameters). So this might be worth following up on?",
