As such, they can serve as an important building block for quantum-resistant information and communication technology.\r\n\r\nI think it'd benefit the broader community (especially, protocol authors looking at adding PQC into their protocols) if some of this latter phrase (\"_important building block_\") could be expanded upon, perhaps enumerating some scenarios in which these trade offs are acceptable.\r\n\r\nE.g., perhaps in the scenario where potential theoretical weakness in the design of SLH-DSA or ML-DSA are an unacceptable risk to an organization (but still desires PQC security), S-HBS schemes could be considered?",

I think that then strengthens the question, in what scenarios _would_ you prefer this set of algorithms? :-) \r\n\r\nE.g., in what scenario would you be able to use S-HBS, if you can't use SLH-DSA? The parties had the former available but not the latter due to (artificially) constrained supply of algorithms? \r\n\r\nEphemeral signing keys (like with [sigstore](https://docs.sigstore.dev/signing/overview/)) would perhaps be one valid use case under that scenario (artificially restricted algorithms)... _with the caveat_ that ML-DSA would likely still be more performant and overall better, assuming resources to support both were present.",
