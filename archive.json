So you need to think about state and memory management. Also see Andreas H\u00fclsing's paper from 2018. At genua we tested JavaCards at some point with similar experiences.

My conclusion was that you need your whole system to be secure at some point in time because you won't be able to handle all the temporary copies within a modern computer. For examples caches are hell. There quite a few of them. Data stored there is only really written to where it should go if being flushed. You do not necessarily want to flush. You're slowing down the whole system and sometimes things may go wrong. Or your OS just decides that what you want is not what the OS wants. You can't just read a recently written key supposedly written to disk to make sure it's stored, because there may be just some cache (maybe even on the hard disk before the actual write operation on the disk). Sometimes you have to trust that everything's alright or it will get messy.\n\n\nI think the point of this is basically: should we elaborate on the design requirements/environment requirements for secure operations at the OS level?",

But  e. g. for the interval approach you could just sacrifice / omit a few (contradicts the last part of chapter four in the Internet-Draft, I think). Imagine the interval in the last point: Your advanced key was written successfully, you start using the OTS keys from the interval that are only stored in volatile memory and suddenly there's a blackout. You restart the system. Worst-case, all keys of your reserved intervall are gone. Bad, but should happen seldomly.\n\nI don't think that this erases all of the state-keeping concerns, but it certainly seems viable as a defense-in-depth approach.

Those two halves could be handled independently.  That is, the first part is stateless, that is, it can be handled just like any other private key, and we can focus in on the dynamically updated second part (the state).\n\nI might want to add to this that there is a funny thing going on where the private key mainly has confidentiality requirements whereas the state has, somewhat uniquely, stricter integrity requirements on whatever storage mechanism, which is also somewhat different from the usual things we expect when handling keys.",

I know of four such techniques, each of which is \u201cbest\u201d by some criteria, and some of which update which nodes are stored during each signature, and one which does not (which ends up using more storage and require more hashes to sign, but also avoid issues with updating the nodes along with the state).

I should be the one to contribute text, should you decide it should be appropriate (although I would like some guidelines as to how thorough I should be \u2013 I could go one for quite some time\u2026)\n\nThe question is do we think this fits in scope?

If we continue in that vein, I believe that you should mention that in XMSS/XMSS^MT, RFC 8391 and NIST SP 800-208 differs on SHAKE-based parameter sets.  I would recommend using the NIST parameter sets, should you decide you need an XMSS+SHAKE parameter set (the SHAKE-128 parameter set that RFC 8391 uses with n=32 reduces security to 128 bits, which is significantly weaker than the design goal).\n>\n>Another thought (if we were continuing with the giving general advice about stateful hash based signatures) is on selecting the parameter set.  For example, LMS with \u201cw=8\u201d (which would be w=256 in XMSS terminology) approximately halves the signature size, at the cost of making the signature generation and verification processes more expensive.  How far should we go into that (given that it is covered by other documents)\n\nI feel that \"picking parameters\" is a bit more of an operator concern and we do already touch on that (for example in that you need to consider your state management solutions when picking parameters).

Privat Key Components\n\n  - is lacking an introductionary sentence, it starts with an itemize right away.\n\n  - \u201d the private key is a static secret\u201d. It should be mentioned that this is only a conceptional view. In actual implementations, the state of the OTS generator may well change with each signature.\n\n- [x] (T2) Section 2.1.2. State Management\n\n  - \u201cto securely update the state after each signature,\u201d This sentence could be read as describing an insecure state update and should be changed to definitely describing a secure state update.\n\n  - \u201csuch as, e.g.,\u201d language: seems to redundantly introduce the example\n\n  - \u201cpuncturable schemes [BSW16],\u201d This technology is not properly introduced in the draft. It should also be made clear whether this references a deployable technology or research that in the future might become deployable technology. Further, I suggest it should be at least outlined how this concept relates to SHBS and the prescriptions of this draft or left completely aside.\n\n- [x] (T3) Section 3. Operational Considerations\n\n  * A paragraph in this section states \u201cIn addition to the state management, implementers MAY consider to implement mechanisms to prevent abrupt signature exhaustion\u201d and then \u201cThis warning condition SHOULD require explicit acknowledgment from the user\u201d. I\u2019d say that the \u201cSHOULD\u201d is inappropriate since the whole mechanism is under \u201cMAY\u201d. I couldn\u2019t figure out what I should understand from this \u201cSHOULD\u201d if I am anyway free to not implement said mechanism of not, due to the \u201cMAY\u201d. So I would prefer to change the \u201cSHOULD\u201d to \u201cMAY\u201d as well.\n\n- [x] (T4) Section 4. Requirements for Secure State Management\n\n  *  \u201cAtomicity: each operation must be indivisible \u2014 either the signature is generated and the state is updated together, or neither\n    occurs.\u201d I see that it is necessary to prevent the release of a signature without state update, but I don\u2019t see why it would be necessary to prevent state update without releasing a signature. I claim that \u201csignature is generated\u201d is not an appropriate concept in any case. Even if the device would internally generate a signature together atomically with the state update, that would not be observable on the outside. If the device is reset after the generation, the state update would persist (as it has to for the operation to be secure) but the signature would be lost before it can be output. I think this statement should be rendered to appropriately describe observable behaviour of the system and thus effectively require state update before signature release and not more.\n\n  * \u201cThe main concerns here are [\u2026] how an accidental/intentional failure/glitch might affect the state security, and cloning.\u201d I don\u2019t understand the final part of the sentence \u201cand cloning\u201d. What is meant exactly how \u201ccloning\u201d is affected? What kind of cloning is considered here?\n\n- [x] (T5) Section 5.2. Distributed Multi-trees (SP-800-208)\n\n  * \u201cThe [SP-800-208]\u201d \u2013 remove \u201cThe\u201d (multiple instances)\n\n- [x] (T6) Section 5.4. Key/State Transfer\n\n  * Please explain what \u201cstrong synchronization\u201d is exactly defining, specifically what the word \u201cstrong\u201d adds to bare \u201csynchronization\u201d.\n\n- [x] (T7) Section 5.6. Variable-length Signature Chains\n\n  * I don\u2019t understand the conclusion about variable length chains given in this section. Is there a way to realize a cryptographic sound solution? If yes, please describe, reference, or outline it. If not, the text should say so explicitly.\n\n  * In my view the explanation given in this section starting with \u201cFrom an operational perspective, the ability of a subordinate tree to sign \neither messages or new subordinate trees leads to severe security implications [\u2026]\u201d is not adequate as it doesn\u2019t clearly answer this \nessential question.\n\n- [x] (T8) Section 7. Security Considerations\n\n  * The text in this section should state that security considerations are given throughout the document.\n\n- [x] (T9) General (and in particular Section 2.1.2., 5.6.)\n\n  * After giving it some more thought, I have general concerns about addressing non-standard cryptographic schemes in this draft. Besides the above topic, this also applies to the reference [BSW16]. My suggestion would be to remove these two references (and others if I should have overlooked them) to research topics or non-standard cryptographic schemes. If the authors consider mentioning these reference as necessary for some reason, that should be done by clearly pointing out that those topics are addressed as potential future technologies. However, I would still have concerns in this case, as it seems impossible to predict how currently non-standard cryptographic ideas might end up as standards. I do not see how the reader of this draft will benefit from such vague references to potential future technologies. I rather see the risk of mismatches, wrong interpretations, and the unintentional facilitation of justifications of the use of non-standard cryptographic schemes.",
